This is version 2.0 of iirish / ispell-gaeilge.

This version is based on the work by Kevin Scannell in
ispell-gaeilge-2.0; other wordlists are present in the source, but
not currently used.
For details, please see:
	http://borel.slu.edu/~kps/ispell/index.html

Set the DICTIONARY variable,eg. set

	DICTIONARY=gaeilge.hash
	export DICTIONARY

in your .bashrc; then the 'gaeilge' dictionary will be used for spell
checking when using ispell. Please consult the documentation on ispell
for further details.

It should also work with Lyx.

Ispell will then store additions to your personal dictionary in the
file ~/.ispell_gaeilge. Please mail this to me, to be added back to the
main dictionary file. I shall endeavour to release updates as frequently
as possible, probably daily.

To test that this works, the file 'lexicons.txt' contains some text in Irish.
You may see the dictionary in action by using:
	ispell lexicons.txt
