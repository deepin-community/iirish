.SH NAME
irish \- flag format for Irish \fIIspell\fP dictionaries
.SH DESCRIPTION
Irish dictionaries for
.IR Ispell (1)
supports 3 prefix and 14 suffix flags.
For a detailed description of how
.I Ispell
handles flags and capitalization, see
.IR Ispell (4).
This manual page only describes flags usable in dictionaries built
using the
.I gaeilge.aff
affix file.
.PP
.PP
The definitive meanings of the affixes is given in the file
.IR /usr/lib/ispell/gaeilge.aff
but some of the reasoning and notes are given here. 
.PP
Irish has an unusual (unique?) capitalization rule, which needs special handling.
Prefixes for eclipsis are not capitalized., e.g.
.B an tEarrach.
.IR Ispell(4) 
assumes that in an uncapitalized word, the first letter may be
capitalized, so 
.B Earrach
would be incorrectly prefixed and capitalized as
.B Tearrach.
.P
The file 
.IR irish-prefixes.pl 
is a 
.IR perl(1) 
script to preprocess the wordlist, and add 'by hand' the correct capitalization.
It will turn
.in +5m
.br
.B Earrach/P
.br
.in -5m
into
.in +5m
.br
.BR Earrach
.br
.BR tEarrach
.in -5m
etc. It strips off the \fBE\fP and \fBP\fP flags used for eclipsis and leaves any other
flags intact. The word should be Capitalized in the the word list; if the uncapitalized version
is left in the word list with the flag, it will generate incorrect words, so enter the
uncapitalized and capitalized versions seperately.
.P
One 'ordinary' prefix is handled by \fIIspell\fP, \fBH\fP is used for aspiration of
nouns, etc. (Verbs are handled separately). 
.P
Twelve suffixes are used for handling regular verbs. We use three suffixes each per conguation: 
one listing all
suffixes available to both aspirated and unaspirated forms, one listing aspirated forms
only, and one for unaspirated forms. So, for the verb \fBmol\fP for example, 
we have in the words list
.in +5m
.br
.BR mol/BC
.br
.BR mhol/BD
.br
.in -5m
so the '\fBB\fP' set of endings apply to both forms, the '\fBC\fP' set to unaspirated only, 
and '\fBD\fP' to aspirated only. This pattern is repeated for all four conjugations.
.P
Irregular verbs just appear in the list in toto.
.P
Two other suffixes are currently defined, , '\fBO\fP'  for Caolú (attenuation),
and '\fBQ\fP'for Leathnú (broadening). 
.P
.SH "BUGS"
The dictionary is very small, and pretty incomplete. Any help would be appreciated.
